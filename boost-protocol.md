# Boost Protocol

## Overview
Boost Protocol is a blockchain-based lending platform protocol that connects Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) with investors through a decentralized credit and investment system. The protocol enables SMEs to build credit history through their transaction patterns while providing investors with fixed-return investment opportunities.

## Core Components

### Node Architecture
1. **Controller Node**
   - Platform's central authority node
   - Manages genesis block creation
   - Controls token minting based on fiat deposits
   - Oversees loan contract deployment
   - Manages investment and insurance pools

2. **SME Nodes**
   - Individual nodes for each participating SME
   - Processes customer payments
   - Records transaction history
   - Handles loan repayments
   - Generates business metrics for credit scoring

3. **Validator Nodes**
   - Run by trusted entities (financial institutions, regulators)
   - Validates transactions and blocks
   - Ensures network integrity
   - Participates in consensus

### Token Economics

#### Native Token (BOOST)
- Backed 1:1 by fiat currency
- Minted upon fiat deposit
- Used for all platform transactions
- Redeemable for fiat currency

#### Insurance Pool
- Percentage allocation from each loan
- Managed via smart contracts
- Provides default protection
- Risk-based allocation system

## Core Processes

### Credit Scoring
1. **Data Collection**
   - Transaction volume and frequency
   - Payment processing history
   - Customer base diversity
   - Business longevity
   - Previous loan performance

2. **Score Calculation**
   - Algorithmic assessment
   - Risk category assignment
   - Interest rate determination
   - Credit limit calculation

### Loan Lifecycle

1. **Application**
   - SME submits loan request
   - Credit score evaluation
   - Risk assessment
   - Terms determination

2. **Investment Pool Creation**
   - Fixed return asset generation
   - Investment opportunity listing
   - Threshold requirements setting
   - Investor allocation tracking

3. **Fund Disbursement**
   - Investment threshold verification
   - Insurance pool allocation
   - Smart contract execution
   - Fund transfer to SME

4. **Repayment Process**
   - Automated periodic interest payments
   - Investor distribution
   - Principal tracking
   - Default monitoring

### Investment Structure

#### Fixed Return Assets
- Risk-adjusted returns
- Defined investment terms
- Minimum investment requirements
- Secondary market capabilities

#### Investment Pools
- Single SME exposure
- Diversified SME baskets
- Industry-specific portfolios
- Risk-matched collections

## Technical Implementation

### Smart Contracts
1. **Loan Contracts**
   - Terms and conditions
   - Repayment schedule
   - Interest rate calculations
   - Default conditions

2. **Investment Contracts**
   - Investor rights
   - Return calculations
   - Distribution logic
   - Exit mechanisms

3. **Insurance Contracts**
   - Risk pool management
   - Claim processing
   - Fund allocation
   - Payout conditions

### Transaction Flow
1. **Payment Processing**
   - Customer â†’ SME transactions
   - Loan disbursements
   - Interest payments
   - Investment returns

2. **Node Synchronization**
   - Block propagation
   - Transaction validation
   - State updates
   - Consensus mechanism

## Risk Management

### Default Protection
- Insurance pool utilization
- Graduated response system
- Recovery procedures
- Investor protection mechanisms

### System Security
- Multi-signature requirements
- Smart contract fail-safes
- Rate limiting
- Attack prevention

## Governance

### Protocol Updates
- Upgrade proposals
- Voting mechanism
- Implementation process
- Backward compatibility

### Compliance
- KYC/AML integration
- Regulatory reporting
- Data protection
- Cross-border considerations

## Future Developments

### Planned Features
